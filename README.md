# CSharpIterationExercises

Complete all the sub programs in IterationExercises following the instructions in the comments</br>

As you complete each program you should run the tests in IterationExerciseTests</br>
If you have written the function correctly the tests should pass</br>

For Q4: Calculate Multiples you should write your own unit test(s) so you can start learning how to write tests</br>
Q6: star pattern is a procedure so should be tested by being called from Program.cs</br>
